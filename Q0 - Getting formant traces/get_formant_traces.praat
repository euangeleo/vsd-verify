# get_formant_traces.praat
#
# This script extracts voiced intervals from a selected Sound object, then finds F1 through
#   F4 values for that sample

# Sources:
#   voiced_extract_auto.txt
#     v 20020423 John TÃ¸ndering, modified quite a lot by Niels Reinholt Petersen
#     v 20200817 modified by Eric Jackson to run in Praat 6.0.04 (2015-11-01)
#
#     The extraction is made without the user having to specify arguments for the "To Pitch (ac)"
#     and "To TextGrid" commands.
#     Testing the script on a number of sentences 15 - 20 seconds long spoken by normal and pathological
#     voices has shown that a reasonably correct extraction of voiced intervals can be achieved
#     by the values of arguments specified below for the To Pitch (ac) and To TextGrid (vuv)
#     commands if the mean_period (To TextGrid (vuv)) varies as a function of the median F0 of the Sound
#     object. The script will handle fundamental frequencies between 60 and 400 Hz. If F0 is lower
#     (e.g. in a creaky male voice) og higher (e.g. in a voice using the falsetto register) the
#     'manually operated' version voiced_extract.psc should be used.

# How did I get the formant file? I think I may have used "FormantPro.praat",
